# CG2402_AI4S

This project is a solution developed for the 2nd Greater Bay Area Cup AI4S Competition. We propose a novel neural network-based numerical method designed to efficiently solve complex mathematical equations, particularly those involving shock waves, discontinuities, and other non-linear physical phenomena.
